Curvy SDK is a Typescript SDK that works in both server and browser environments and
gives you the complete feature set of the Curvy protocol.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xCurvy/curvy-sdk/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0xcurvy/curvy-sdk)

## Installation

Curvy SDK can be installed with a Node package manager:

```
pnpm install @0xcurvy/curvy-sdk
```

The easiest way to get started is to run the provided `curvy-os` example app:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xCurvy/curvy-sdk.git
cd example/curvy-os
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

After opening the plain JS/HTML app in your browser, configure the API key you have received from the team, and
you will have the complete set of features in the Curvy SDK at your disposal through the primitive UI of `curvy-os`.

For more information on how to use the SDK, please refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.curvy.box/sdk/).
